"""Post-processing of the Anemoi-Spread ensemble into forecast products.

Scope v2.1 §6.1. Cone of uncertainty, intensity PDF, landfall probability and
the rapid-intensification flag.

Note on the cone: NHC's official cone is built from *historical* official-forecast
error percentiles, not from the current ensemble spread. A cone drawn from a
model's own spread is only honest if that spread is calibrated, which is exactly
what :func:`anemoi.metrics.probabilistic.spread_skill` measures. This module
therefore computes both and refuses to emit an ensemble-derived cone when the
ensemble is underdispersed -- falling back to the climatological radii instead.

#: NHC-style 2/3-probability circle radii (nm) by lead time, current-season
#: Atlantic basin values (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutcone.shtml).
#:
#: NHC sizes each circle so that two-thirds of official forecast errors over the
#: previous five years fall within it, and re-derives the table annually --
#: these are the 2026 radii (based on 2021-2025 error statistics; NHC's page
#: also lists 60h, which this module's ``products.lead_hours`` does not use).
#: Documented alongside the same values in ``configs/inference.yaml`` under
#: ``ensemble.climatological_cone_nm``; there is no config loader yet (see
#: Roadmap "Config loader"), so the two must be kept in sync by hand like every
#: other module constant here. Re-baseline this table every season rather than
#: assuming it stays reasonable.
#:
#: Note for the 2026 season NHC is trialling a cone built from **ellipses** rather
#: than circles, separating the along-track (speed) and cross-track (directional)
#: error components. That is the decomposition metrics.track.cross_along_track_nm
#: already computes, so an elliptical ConeSegment -- semi-major, semi-minor and
#: orientation in place of a single radius -- is a natural extension here.
