"""Shared plumbing for the torch-backed model implementations.

Torch is an optional dependency (``pip install anemoi[torch]``). The
operational layers -- scheduling, availability, curriculum, promotion, metrics --
carry the v2.1 policy and must remain importable and testable without it, so the
import is deferred and failure is a clear message rather than a stack trace at
module load.
