"""Retraining triggers.

Scope v2.1 §5.5, with the §5.7 dependency correction. v2's drift trigger said
"retrain the affected model only", which is wrong for any Group 1 model: the
diffusion and fusion models are trained on latents extracted from Group 1
checkpoints, so retraining an LSTM in isolation leaves Anemoi-Spread conditioned on
representations that no longer exist. :func:`expand_jobs` applies the cascade so
the invalidation is automatic rather than remembered.
